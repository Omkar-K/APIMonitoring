# APIMonitoring

A web application to monitor APIs in a periodic and extensive manner.


Application Programming Interface (API) is a way for different services to work together. It provides an interface between applications to interact and share information. These days it is hard to find a service that does not use an API. There are APIs to look up a recipe, lyrics, or weather and also logging you in. The web APIs we want to integrate into our application must give expected response time and provide reliability or it can result in application failure. For this, there are various tools available today such as Postman and Loggly. The current API Monitoring methods are hard to learn and have limited usability and can cost you a premium. In this paper, we have discussed a simple and effective approach to monitoring APIs over a given period. A user can simply enter details for the monitor while the tool does the work. It supports iterations per request and interval of at least 1 minute. Supports separate services for private and public APIs and also a comparison tool. Interactive graphical data demonstrates how the API is functioning when simulated in extensive scenarios. The generated data can help the developer to assess the performance of the API.
